#  Quizzler

## Description
I created this app as part of the App Brewery's "Complete iOS App Development Bootcamp" course on Udemy. We create a Trivia Quiz App, but I have adapted the app to my own by using real-life medical school revision questions. Additionally, multiple-choice quiz apps on the App Store are one of the most popular styles of educational apps on the App Store.

This app was important to make because I learned about the MVC pattern and implemented it. Innovating on top of the base features made this app feel more impactful in my learning (See what makes this project stand out section for more details). 

## Learning Objectives

What did I learn? How did building this app improve my iOS development skills?

There are several concepts that I was able to learn whilst developing this app. This includes:

* How to programmatically change UI elements such as Labels and Buttons.
* Learn what is a design pattern and how is it used in programming.
* How to use the MVC pattern.
* Learn about Swift Structures how to instantiate a struct instance.
* Learn about Swift Classes and creating Objects.
* Understand the difference between value types and reference types.
* Compare Swift Classes with Swift Structs and know when to use which.
* Learn about Object Oriented Programming.
* How to refactor code and stay organised.

## What makes this project stand out?

In addition to the base features that was developed in the course, I added my own touches to further my learning, such as:

* Use real-life medical school revision questions instead of the given quiz from the course.
* In the course we implement 1 quiz. In my version, I implement 3 unique quizzes (A Renal Quiz, Rhuematology and Cardiovascular Quiz).
* Allow users to switch between quizzes using a button, and implemented a UIAlertController to show those options. (Renal, Rhuematology, or Cardiovascular)
* In the course, we create 2 buttons to show 2 possible answers for each question (True/False). In my app version, there are 6 buttons to show 6 possible answers for each question.
* Add constants file to organise and store all quiz information, including a new title property that describes the type of question being asked (E.g. In the Cardiovascualar quiz, there is a Heart Failure question, and a Chest Pain Question). This helps users understand the problem better.
* Progress View has rounded edges
* Use UIView.animate instead of timer() to update the UI.
* Add documentation comments
